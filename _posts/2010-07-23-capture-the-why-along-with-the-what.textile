When discussing / thinking about / reviewing an area of code you often think of 'bright ideas' to include 'next time' you make a change in the same area. i.e. whilst performing a future change, just implement the bright idea 'whilst you are there'...

By building a habit of recording both the 'what' and the 'why' you can evaluate whether the idea is still 'bright' at any point in the future.

It is so frustrating to be updating code, see a change note you've written to yourself for 'next time', but be unable to see why it was written originally or was once appropriate.

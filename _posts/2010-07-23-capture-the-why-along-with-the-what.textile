When discussing / thinking about / reviewing an area of code you often think of 'bright ideas' to include 'next time' you make a change in the same area. i.e. whilst performing a future change, just implement the bright idea 'whilst you are there'...

You can evaluate whether the idea is still 'bright' at any point in the future by building a habit of recording both the 'what' *and* the 'why'.

It is so frustrating to be updating code, see a change note you've written to yourself for 'next time', but be unable to see why it was written originally or was once appropriate.

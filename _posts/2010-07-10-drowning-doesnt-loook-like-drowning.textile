This is an article I saw via "Hacker News post":http://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=1492835 about how "Drowning doesn't look like drowning":http://mariovittone.com/2010/05/154/.

Details how the body's survival needs (i.e. get oxygen, stay on the surface) outweighs the person's ability to call out for help - highlights how the Hollywood / TV show depictions of drowning with splashing as a 'signal' to others doesn't match the reality of the quiet struggle to live. 

Also reminds (especially in the Hacker News post) about how the drowning person's instincts to use a potential rescuer to rise above the water's surface (get oxygen, stay alive) can endanger the rescuer's safety.

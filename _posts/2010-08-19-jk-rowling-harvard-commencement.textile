<p><b>JK Rowling Speaks at Harvard Commencement</b></p>

I have watched this <a href="http://vimeo.com/1711302">commencement speech</a> a few times over the years and have enjoyed it immensely each time. From the understated humour, to the suggestion/reminder to her audience of students who will have influence over their lifetimes to remember the powerless, it plants seeds that will give thoughts that may flower over the coming years.

I also enjoyed her inclusion of lifetime university friends as villains in her Harry Potter novels.

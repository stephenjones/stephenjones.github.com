<h1>Cindy Scott - Fertile Mind Hypnotherapy</h1>

<p>Now at the rooms of 'five elements' in Fitzroy North, <a href="http://www.fiveelements.com.au/hypnotherapy.html">Cindy Scott</a> is focussing on using hypnotherapy in the areas of <a href="http://www.fertilemindhypnotherapy.com.au/fertile-mind-birthing/">HypnoBirthing</a>, <a href="http://www.fertilemindhypnotherapy.com.au/fertile-mind-fertility/">HypnoFertility</a>, and the use of <a href="http://www.fertilemindhypnotherapy.com.au/fertile-mind-menopause/">Hypnotherapy during Menopause</a>.</p>

<p>Quoting from her website (at <a href="http://www.fertilemindhypnotherapy.com.au/">Fertile Mind Hypnotherapy</a>):</p>

<p>"Hypnotherapy is a natural state of deep relaxation that accesses the subconscious mind in order to facilitate change. It is a powerful, safe and drug-free treatment that can be used in conjunction with other health therapies or as a stand-alone modality. At Fertile Mind Hypnotherapy, each session is individually tailored to facilitate effective and lasting changes."</p>

<p>"Cindy is a Clinical Hypnotherapist, a Registered Nurse and a Registered Midwife; as well as a Lactation Consultant and a Childbirth Educator (Grad Dip). She is passionate about the potential for hypnotherapy to facilitate positive change. Having worked as a Childbirth Educator for over 15 years and a Midwife for over 10 years, she brings a wealth of clinical experience to her practice. Combining these skills with hypnotherapy has resulted in the birth of a unique programme that provides practical techniques and a powerful therapy for creating change."</p>

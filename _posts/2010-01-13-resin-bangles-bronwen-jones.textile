<p>My sister, <a href="http://www.etsy.com/shop/whizzbangle">Bronwen Jones</a>, is making and selling <a href="http://www.etsy.com/shop/whizzbangle">resin bangles</a> for sale under the <a href="http://www.etsy.com/shop/whizzbangle">whizzbangle</a> brand name.</p>

<p>Bronwen was recently interviewed by the 'unicorn meat' blog (which talks about jewelry amongst other things...) about the <a href="http://www.unicornmeat.com/2010/01/jewelry-interview-whizzbangle.html">bangles</a> she makes and where she gets her design ideas.</p>

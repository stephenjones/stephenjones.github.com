<h1>Cindy Scott offers Virtual Gastric Band Hypnotherapy</h1>

<p>Cindy has just relaunched her website with a renewed focus on '<a href="http://www.fertilemindhypnotherapy.com.au/">Gastric Band Hynotherapy</a>'. Based out of rooms at '<a href="">five elements</a>' in North Fitzroy in Melbourne (near Northcote), she offers the program on an individual basis, rather than in groups.</p>

<p>From her website: "The Virtual Gastric Band Programme works by retraining the mind to be satisfied with smaller portions of food. There is no diet or food group restrictions imposed; though many clients report that they start to notice themselves eating more healthy foods over the duration of the programme.</p>

<p>Completing the Programme provides weight loss without undergoing the surgical procedure of gastric banding in a hospital. The Virtual Gastric Band does not involve the risks associated with surgical and anaesthetic procedures, no medications, no hospital waiting lists, fraction of the cost of the operation, no pain and no ‘down time’ afterwards."</p>

<p>Cindy can be contacted via her mobile on 0458 210 281, or via the <a href="http://www.fertilemindhypnotherapy.com.au/#!visit-us/c24vq">inquiry form</a> on her website.</p>

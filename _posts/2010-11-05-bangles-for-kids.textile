<p><b>Small resin bangles for kids care of Whizzbangle</b></p>

For her birthday, I gave a friend's 3 year old daughter a set of small resin bangles care of my sister Bronwen's handiwork from <a href="http://www.etsy.com/shop/whizzbangle">whizzbangle (resin bangles and related jewellery)</a>. Bronwen made some suitably-sized bangles up and posted them. Thanks Sis!

For those thinking of Christmas, these would be a great stocking stuffer for any young one!

This was their presentation before being given as a gift:

No young munchkin should be without a set!

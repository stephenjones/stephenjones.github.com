<p>"Github":http://www.github.com has posted a competition to generate an open sourced recommendation algorithm that can be used by anyone who needs such a thing, and specifically one that they can use themselves. The "competition":http://contest.github.com is an attempt to help 'solve' the problem in public, so that it doesn't need to be resolved by each new group that needs such an algorithm... </p>

<p>It looks like the recently completed "Netflix Prize":http://www.netflixprize.com/ has warmed many people to the problem domain (recommendation), and a "few players":http://contest.github.com/leaderboard have actively and quickly reached recommendation 'scores' of just under 50% accuracy. As I write this, a score of 44%+ would be required to break into the 'top 10' on the 'leaderboard'.</p>

<p>"My attempts":http://contest.github.com/p/stephenjones/contest2009-sj are more modest and I am using this as an excuse to code some ruby (in my unskilled style...), and learn a little about recommendation and 'prediction'.</p>
